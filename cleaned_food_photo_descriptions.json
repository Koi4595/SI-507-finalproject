Genus Ocimum Species O basilicum Binomial name Ocimum basilicum L Basil bzl1 also US bezl2 Ocimum basilicum smm bzlkm34 also called great basil is a culinary herb of the family Lamiaceae mints It is a tender plant and is used in cuisines worldwide In Western cuisine the generic term quotbasilquot refers to the variety also known as sweet basil or Genovese basil Basil is native to tropical regions from Central Africa to Southeast Asia5 In temperate climates basil is treated as an annual plant however basil can be grown as a shortlived perennial or biennial in warmer horticultural zones with tropical or Mediterranean climates5 There are many varieties of basil including sweet basil Thai basil O basilicum var thyrsiflora and Mrs Burns Lemon O basilicum var citriodora O basilicum can crosspollinate with other species of the Ocimum genus producing hybrids such as lemon basil O citriodorum and African blue basil O kilimandscharicum Description Timelapse of growing basil Desiccated basil showing seed dispersal Basil is an annual or sometimes perennial herb used for its leaves Depending on the variety plants can reach heights of between 30 and 150 centimetres 1 and 5 feet6 Basil leaves are glossy and ovulate with smooth or slightly toothed edges that typically cup slightly the leaves are arranged oppositely along the square stems7 Leaves may be green or purple Its flowers are small and white and grow from a central inflorescence or spike that emerges from the central stem atop the plantcitation needed Unusual among Lamiaceae the four stamens and the pistil are not pushed under the upper lip of the corolla but lie over the inferior lip After entomophilous pollination the corolla falls off and four round achenes develop inside the bilabiate calyxcitation needed Phytochemistry The various basils have such distinct scents because the volatile aromatic compounds vary with cultivars5 The essential oil from European basil contains high concentrations of linalool and methyl chavicol estragole in a ratio of about 3158 Other constituents include 18cineole eugenol and myrcene among others59 The clove scent of sweet basil is derived from eugenol10 The aroma profile of basil includes 18cineole1112 and methyl eugenol1113 In this species eugenol is synthesised from coniferyl acetate and NADPH14 Similar species Some similar species in the same genus may be

sensitive to cold with best growth in hot dry conditions It behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost However due to its popularity basil is cultivated in many countries around the world Production areas include countries in the Mediterranean area those in the temperate zone and others in subtropical climates23page needed In Northern Europe Canada the northern states of the US and the South Island of New Zealand basil grows best if sown under glass in a peat pot then planted out in late springearly summer when there is little chance of a frost however it can also thrive when planted outside in these climates Additionally it may be sown in soil once chance of frost is past It fares best in welldrained soil with direct exposure to the suncitation needed Although basil grows best outdoors it can be grown indoors in a pot and like most herbs will do best on a sunfacing windowsill kept away from extremely cold drafts A greenhouse or row cover is ideal if available It can however even be grown in a basement under fluorescent lights Supplemental lighting produces greater biomass and phenol production with red blue specifically increasing growth and flower bud production UVB increases the volatiles in O basilicum essential oil which has not been reproducible in other plants and so may be unique to the genus or even to this species24 Basil plants require regular watering but not as much attention as is needed in other climates If its leaves have wilted from lack of water it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant has been stressed usually this means that it needs less water or less or more fertilizer25 Basil can be propagated reliably from cuttings with the stems of short cuttings suspended in water for two weeks or until roots develop Pruning flowering and seeding Female carpenter bee foraging Once a stem produces flowers foliage production stops on that stem the stem becomes woody and essential oil production declines To prevent this a basilgrower may pinch off any flower stems before they are fully mature Because only the blooming stem is so affected some stems can be pinched for leaf production while others are left to bloom for decoration or seeds Picking the leaves off the plant helps promote growth largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems Once the plant is allowed to flower it may produce seed pods containing small black seeds which can be saved and planted the following year If allowed to go to seed a basil plant will grow back the next year Diseases Basil suffers from several plant pathogens that can ruin the crop and reduce yield Fusarium wilt is a soilborne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants Seedlings may be killed by Pythium damping off A common foliar disease of basil is gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea it can cause infections postharvest and is capable of killing the entire plant Black spot can be seen on basil foliage and is caused by the fungi genus Colletotrichum Downy mildew caused by

        "description": "Onion Bulbous vegetable grown for food This article is about the plant For other uses see Onion disambiguation quotOnionsquot redirects here For the surname see Onions surname An onion Allium cepa L from Latin cepa meaning quotonionquot also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which may irritate the eyes Taxonomy and etymology Roots leaves and developing bulb The onion plant Allium cepa also known as the bulb onion or common onion 910 is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium It was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum A number of synonyms have appeared in its taxonomic history Allium cepa var aggregatum G Don Allium cepa var bulbiferum Regel Allium cepa var cepa Linnaeus Allium cepa var multiplicans LH Bailey Allium cepa var proliferum Moench Regel Allium cepa var solaninum Alef Allium cepa var viviparum Metz Mansf A cepa is known exclusively from cultivation but related wild species occur in Central Asia and Iran The most closely related species include A vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A asarense from Iran The vast majority of cultivars of A cepa belong to the common onion group A cepa var cepa and are usually referred to simply as onions The Aggregatum Group of cultivars A cepa var aggregatum includes both shallots and potato onions 2021 The genus Allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion A fistulosum Egyptian onion A proliferum and Canada onion A canadense 910 Cepa is commonly accepted as Latin for quotonionquot and has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric

This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases

has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well

has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well

English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from

contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the

12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production

shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases

better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

An onion Allium cepa L from Latin cepa meaning quotonionquot also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which may irritate the eyes Taxonomy and etymology Roots leaves and developing bulb The onion plant Allium cepa also known as the bulb onion or common onion 910 is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium It was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum A number of synonyms have appeared in its taxonomic history Allium cepa var aggregatum G Don Allium cepa var bulbiferum Regel Allium cepa var cepa Linnaeus Allium cepa var multiplicans LH Bailey Allium cepa var proliferum Moench Regel Allium cepa var solaninum Alef Allium cepa var viviparum Metz Mansf A cepa is known exclusively from cultivation but related wild species occur in Central Asia and Iran The most closely related species include A vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A asarense from Iran The vast majority of cultivars of A cepa belong to the common onion group A cepa var cepa and are usually referred to simply as onions The Aggregatum Group of cultivars A cepa var aggregatum includes both shallots and potato onions 2021 The genus Allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion A fistulosum Egyptian onion A proliferum and Canada onion A canadense 910 Cepa is commonly accepted as Latin for quotonionquot and has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some

12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia

        "description": "Onion Bulbous vegetable grown for food This article is about the plant For other uses see Onion disambiguation quotOnionsquot redirects here For the surname see Onions surname An onion Allium cepa L from Latin cepa meaning quotonionquot also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which may irritate the eyes Taxonomy and etymology Roots leaves and developing bulb The onion plant Allium cepa also known as the bulb onion or common onion 910 is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium It was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum A number of synonyms have appeared in its taxonomic history Allium cepa var aggregatum G Don Allium cepa var bulbiferum Regel Allium cepa var cepa Linnaeus Allium cepa var multiplicans LH Bailey Allium cepa var proliferum Moench Regel Allium cepa var solaninum Alef Allium cepa var viviparum Metz Mansf A cepa is known exclusively from cultivation but related wild species occur in Central Asia and Iran The most closely related species include A vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A asarense from Iran The vast majority of cultivars of A cepa belong to the common onion group A cepa var cepa and are usually referred to simply as onions The Aggregatum Group of cultivars A cepa var aggregatum includes both shallots and potato onions 2021 The genus Allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion A fistulosum Egyptian onion A proliferum and Canada onion A canadense 910 Cepa is commonly accepted as Latin for quotonionquot and has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some

Genus Ocimum Species O basilicum Binomial name Ocimum basilicum L Basil bzl1 also US bezl2 Ocimum basilicum smm bzlkm34 also called great basil is a culinary herb of the family Lamiaceae mints It is a tender plant and is used in cuisines worldwide In Western cuisine the generic term quotbasilquot refers to the variety also known as sweet basil or Genovese basil Basil is native to tropical regions from Central Africa to Southeast Asia5 In temperate climates basil is treated as an annual plant however basil can be grown as a shortlived perennial or biennial in warmer horticultural zones with tropical or Mediterranean climates5 There are many varieties of basil including sweet basil Thai basil O basilicum var thyrsiflora and Mrs Burns Lemon O basilicum var citriodora O basilicum can crosspollinate with other species of the Ocimum genus producing hybrids such as lemon basil O citriodorum and African blue basil O kilimandscharicum Description Timelapse of growing basil Desiccated basil showing seed dispersal Basil is an annual or sometimes perennial herb used for its leaves Depending on the variety plants can reach heights of between 30 and 150 centimetres 1 and 5 feet6 Basil leaves are glossy and ovulate with smooth or slightly toothed edges that typically cup slightly the leaves are arranged oppositely along the square stems7 Leaves may be green or purple Its flowers are small and white and grow from a central inflorescence or spike that emerges from the central stem atop the plantcitation needed Unusual among Lamiaceae the four stamens and the pistil are not pushed under the upper lip of the corolla but lie over the inferior lip After entomophilous pollination the corolla falls off and four round achenes develop inside the bilabiate calyxcitation needed Phytochemistry The various basils have such distinct scents because the volatile aromatic compounds vary with cultivars5 The essential oil from European basil contains high concentrations of linalool and methyl chavicol estragole in a ratio of about 3158 Other constituents include 18cineole eugenol and myrcene among others59 The clove scent of sweet basil is derived from eugenol10 The aroma profile of basil includes 18cineole1112 and methyl eugenol1113 In this species eugenol is synthesised from coniferyl acetate and NADPH14 Similar species Some similar species in the same genus may be

quotroyalkingly plantquot possibly because the plant was believed to have been used in production of royal perfumes21 Basil is likewise sometimes referred to in French as quotlherbe royalequot the royal herb22 The Latin name has been confused with basilisk as it was supposed to be an antidote to the basilisks venom21 Distribution and habitat Basil is native to India and other tropical regions

sensitive to cold with best growth in hot dry conditions It behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost However due to its popularity basil is cultivated in many countries around the world Production areas include countries in the Mediterranean area those in the temperate zone and others in subtropical climates23page needed In Northern Europe Canada the northern states of the US and the South Island of New Zealand basil grows best if sown under glass in a peat pot then planted out in late springearly summer when there is little chance of a frost however it can also thrive when planted outside in these climates Additionally it may be sown in soil once chance of frost is past It fares best in welldrained soil with direct exposure to the suncitation needed Although basil grows best outdoors it can be grown indoors in a pot and like most herbs will do best on a sunfacing windowsill kept away from extremely cold drafts A greenhouse or row cover is ideal if available It can however even be grown in a basement under fluorescent lights Supplemental lighting produces greater biomass and phenol production with red blue specifically increasing growth and flower bud production UVB increases the volatiles in O basilicum essential oil which has not been reproducible in other plants and so may be unique to the genus or even to this species24 Basil plants require regular watering but not as much attention as is needed in other climates If its leaves have wilted from lack of water it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant has been stressed usually this means that it needs less water or less or more fertilizer25 Basil can be propagated reliably from cuttings with the stems of short cuttings suspended in water for two weeks or until roots develop Pruning flowering and seeding Female carpenter bee foraging Once a stem produces flowers foliage production stops on that stem the stem becomes woody and essential oil production declines To prevent this a basilgrower may pinch off any flower stems before they are fully mature Because only the blooming stem is so affected some stems can be pinched for leaf production while others are left to bloom for decoration or seeds Picking the leaves off the plant helps promote growth largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems Once the plant is allowed to flower it may produce seed pods containing small black seeds which can be saved and planted the following year If allowed to go to seed a basil plant will grow back the next year Diseases Basil suffers from several plant pathogens that can ruin the crop and reduce yield Fusarium wilt is a soilborne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants Seedlings may be killed by Pythium damping off A common foliar disease of basil is gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea it can cause infections postharvest and is capable of killing the entire plant Black spot can be seen on basil foliage and is caused by the fungi genus Colletotrichum Downy mildew caused by Peronospora belbahrii is a significant disease as first reported in Italy in 200326 It was reported in the Florida in 2007 and by 2008 had spread along the eastern United States reaching Canada2728

Chinese medicine34 3334 Insecticide and insect repellent Studies of the essential oil have shown insecticidal and insectrepelling properties35 including potential toxicity to mosquitos36 The essential oil is found by Huignard et al 2008 to inhibit electrical activity by decreasing action potential amplitude by shortening the post hyperpolarization phase and reducing the action frequency of action potentials In Huignards opinion this is due to the linalool and estragole the amplitude reduction due to linalool and the phase shortening due to both37 Callosobruchus maculatus a pest which affects cowpea is repelled by the essential oil37 The essential oil mixed with kaolin is both an adulticide and an ovicide effective for three months against C maculatus in cowpea37 The thrips Frankliniella

botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases

are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

        "description": "Wednesday Road trip Road and ferry trip really Denmark is made up of Jutland and a lot of islands Big islands small islands tiny islands Linked by bridges and ferries To go from Jutland to Copenhagen you either go on the highway via the Great Belt Bridge or you go south via smaller roads and the ferry linking Langeland and Tars As Odense where we were staying was an hours drive from Langeland we would go by ferry And we were going as there is a factory that manufactures turbine blades on the island the other end of the ferry Each time we were to meet to drive somewhere it was always best to plan departure some 15 earlier than your actual desired time as herding the team was like herding cats Wheels was to be at half seven we told them and as planned wheels turned at quarter to giving us just over an hour to drove to the ferry port across countryside and picturesque brickbuilt villages and towns spread over several smaller and smaller islands until we reached the ferry port You by a ticket from a vending machine and wait for the ferry to arrive its supposed to leave on the hour but timings had slipped We could see it approaching but we had time to wander round the port I last used the ferry in the depths of winter with wind and rain lashing down most unpleasant for a walk Back into the car to drive onto the ferry then climb the three flights of stairs to the lounges and caf Our boss bought us coffee and we sat staring out of the window as the ferry glided out of the dock Forty five minutes later we arrived the other side and a mere ten minutes later saw us arrive at the fishing port and shipbuilding town of Nakskov They now make turbine blades We drove to the factory set among the wasteland that used to be filled with dockyards and entered We had meetings lunch and a tour then walked back out at quarter to three to get to the car to drive to Tars to catch the ferry at half three While we waited a VW camper van with four young ladies from Berlin had a picnic and some optimistic sunbathing but also offered to take shots of our group This time I treated myself to an ice cream as the ferry pulled out of the dock and outside the breeze had dropped to levels that meant the inland sea was dead calm giving perfect reflections And hour later we got off the ferry and forty five minutes later we were in the centre of Odense where I had booked us into an Indian restaurant for dinner With five vegetarians picking the right place to eat was tricky doubly so when Tripadvisor said that the best restaurant for vegetarians in the city was Flammen a BBQ restaurant that has a salad bar but one heck of a lot of grilled meat And being an Indian place the guys should find something they liked But first we had an hour to kill So they went off in one direction me in another to find somewhere to sit because of my knee but in my stumblings I found the medieval heart of the city with a timber framed inn and other buildings round a courtyard while across the new tram tracks was Hans Christian Andersens House now with a snazzy new photogenic visitor centre I took lots of shots and then found a bench to sit and call Jools Then to walk to the restaurant to find that it was owned and run by a guy from Pakistan and who prided himself in authentic food which it was I had warned them that our party of nine included six Indians so all was good They did a quotpick n mixquot menu where instead of full portions you had quarters but could choose three five or seven dishes and mix them on your plate as you ate giving each mouthful a different taste combination It was a great meal but come nine they closed and firmly asked us to pay and leave which we did I drove us back through the darkened city centre back out to Munkebo and the hotel Time to watch the second half of the Citeh v Real game though I was too wacked to watch extra time with the scores level at 33",

An onion Allium cepa L from Latin cepa meaning quotonionquot also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are

has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

An onion Allium cepa L from Latin cepa meaning quotonionquot also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are

related species include A vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A asarense from Iran The vast majority of cultivars of A cepa belong to the common onion group A cepa var cepa and are usually referred to simply as onions The Aggregatum Group of cultivars A cepa var aggregatum includes both shallots and potato onions 2021 The genus Allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as

has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The

Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are

plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well

are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from

12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

An onion Allium cepa L from Latin cepa meaning quotonionquot also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which may irritate the eyes Taxonomy and etymology Roots leaves and developing bulb The onion plant Allium cepa also known as the bulb onion or common onion 910 is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium It was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum A number of synonyms have appeared in its taxonomic history Allium cepa var aggregatum G Don Allium cepa var bulbiferum Regel Allium cepa var cepa Linnaeus Allium cepa var multiplicans LH Bailey Allium cepa var proliferum Moench Regel Allium cepa var solaninum Alef Allium cepa var viviparum Metz Mansf A cepa is known exclusively from cultivation but related wild species occur in Central Asia and Iran The most closely related species include A vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A asarense from Iran The vast majority of cultivars of A cepa belong to the common onion group A cepa var cepa and are usually referred to simply as onions The Aggregatum Group of cultivars A cepa var aggregatum includes both shallots and potato onions 2021 The genus Allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion A fistulosum Egyptian onion A proliferum and Canada onion A canadense 910 Cepa is commonly accepted as Latin for quotonionquot and has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some

animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to

from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia

or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional

English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used

related species include A vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A asarense from Iran The vast majority of cultivars of A cepa belong to the common onion group A cepa var cepa and are usually referred to simply as onions The Aggregatum Group of cultivars A cepa var aggregatum includes both shallots and potato onions 2021 The genus Allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion A fistulosum Egyptian onion A proliferum and Canada onion A canadense 910 Cepa is commonly accepted as Latin for quotonionquot and has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are

        "description": "Someone has to provide the entertainment dont they It was all going on at Portreath as Kathleen thrashed the cliffs the beach and the Monkey Hut at high tide on an exhilarating Saturday afternoon By now wed stood on the cliffs beside the pepperpot and wed watched the action from Dead Mans Hut where we had to queue patiently for a front row view Finally we headed down to the beach Not on the beach that wasnt happening unless you were wearing a wetsuit preferably with a long leash tied around an ankle with the other end tethered to a bollard in the car park But on the small esplanade between the car park and the beach reduced to shingle after a particularly vigorous winter season I dont come to Portreath that often Its not even five miles away from our front door but I have a habit of overlooking it despite the obvious attractions In warmer months Ive often coasted down the cycle trail for an ice cream on the front before puffing my way back up the slope in a very low gear sometimes stopping for coffee at the farm campsite and cafe that friends of mine run Occasionally there will be some form of family gathering there usually for a childs birthday party in summer But apart from that I just pass on through usually heading for Godrevy and then only if in an idle moment Ive decided to take the coast road But when theres a storm this is the first place I always think of Porthleven on the south coast often has the biggest waves but I rarely drag myself over that way I should really come to Portreath more often The crumbling coastal path in both directions remains largely unexplored on my part and I suspect there are some rather good views along those cliffs that change with every passing winter as another few hundred tons of loose rock slide into the ocean From here its a short but strenuous hike east to Porthtowan or a slightly longer one to Godrevy via North Cliffs and Hells Mouth Another famous landmark where Ive never taken a photo What on earth have I been doing you might ask As storms go Kathleen was a tame puppy in comparison to some of the hoolies weve witnessed here Theres no way some of the monstrous assaults on our coastline would have seen surfers taking to the water but nine or ten of them were already bobbing about on the waves when we arrived and another was about to join the party Or was he For fifteen or twenty minutes he edged back and forth never coming inside or anywhere near the third in my frame I might add watched by a crowd of day trippers whod come to enjoy the elements in the couple of hours during which it had somehow remained dry Id already changed from the long lens set up the tripod and popped a filter on hoping to catch the sea dragging back around his ankles and now I was just willing him to stand still at least a teensy bit in from the edge of the frame as I clunked away at the shutter with each receding carpet of white foam Finally he saw something that the rest of us couldnt and plodded off into the water With a winter wetsuit and a pair of fins on his feet I could only imagine how exciting it would be to nail those waves today Not long afterwards it began to rain hard and we raced back to the car and headed home to put the kettle on I love how this one turned out with the bodyboarder gazing enigmatically out to sea calculating the conditions as he waits The first thing that I liked was the wake created in the surf as the water flowed back around our heros legs That alone made this my instant choice from the group of shots I took here But when I looked closer on the big screen everything about the day was here Another roller about to explode extravagantly over the poor maligned Monkey Hut on the end of the breakwater A wall of white spray groping for holds on the side of the porous cliffs on top of which sits the lonely Pepperpot A car driving up Lighthouse Hill seemingly oblivious to events going on around it And if you look in youll see the huddle at the Dead Mans Hut some of them armed with expensive camera gear while others are just enjoying the experience And just below them the young man leaning over the railings with a woman near him thinking shes safe Just a few exposures later the space is swamped by a wave Ive seen plenty of people take a soaking there on days like this Im sure some of them do it for kicks If ever you asked me to show you a picture that described the place Id look no further Visceral effervescent bristling with white water and always some crazy soul armed with a board prepared to take it all on for that unforgettable ride This is Portreath and its never dull",

        "description": "This is the perfect mild seafood coating mix for frying fish and shellfish This blend used cornmeal as its base We blended some unique spices and got a phenomenal coating for deep frying or pan frying Best uses are fish clams oysters shrimp and even lobster Weve added a small amount of Sea Salt per bottle so you may need to add a little to fit your taste Lets do things the oldfashioned way Empty the coating into a brown paper bag add seafood shake vigorously and into the grease you go We make this mixture both spicy and mild for those discerning tastes This mix comes in 30oz resealable bottles for maintaining freshness and is 100 additive and preservative free The coatingbatter turns into a shell that keeps the sensitive protein in place and stops it from sticking to the hot surface of the pan Coating can also make it easier to fry fish meat that tends to fall apart Dip the piece of food in a beaten egg and coat it with breadcrumbs before frying For more consistency and a moisty result dredge the food with flour between egg and breadcrumbs If you are looking for a puffier result you can also add some baking powder to the flour or egg Usage Coating fish before frying gives lean fish more flavor because the coating adds a crispy mouth feel and absorbs the flavors of the frying fat Mild seafood coating makes cooking delicate fish even easier This mix also works well for freshwater fish appsengprodtechcomproductmildseafoodcoating",

down to breakfast with Henrik before going to pack my things Breakfast has bacon rolls made with crispy Danish bacon which is always cooked to perfection There is also lashings of strong black coffee I pay the bill and go outside to see Parandaman and Rajesh waiting beside the van pointing to the frost on the windscreen the first time they have ever seen such a thing Henrik had to scrape his screen with a tool they told me I touched the frost and found it already melting so I said thered be no need for scraping I switched on the ignition and the wipers cleared all frost in three swipes They were amazed As we drove to the factory the inside of the screen began to mist up something else they had never screen I turned a dial to make the fans of the heating go faster and in a few seconds the screen was clear again They were amazed We arrived at the dock gates were allowed in and so drove to the meeting room being the first to arrive The 19th Friday is the 14th anniversary of my joining the company though it has changed identities twice since then it is soon to be Henriks and Runes 10th anniversary too so a cake had been supplied to celebrate and that greeted us when we walked into the classroom After lunch I had to say goodbye to my boss and colleagues so a final round of handshakes and hugs and I walked out of the building to the car Instead of setting the sat nav I set up a podcast thinking I knew my way I was pretty sure So out of the port and along to the O3 ring then north on the E20 and cruising along at 100 to 110 kmh The sun shone the birds sang and along the side of the road butterbur was just turning to seed It took about an hour and 50 minutes to get to Billund and another ten minutes to walk to the terminal from the drop off point only to discover the Britsh Airways desk unmanned and I was told that I could not drop the case off until two hours before departure time The first time this rule has been enforced here I checked in my case and then went through the priority gate at security and up to the lounge where I paid 200DKK for access so I could join the last of the meetings of the workshop but for the most part heard those in the room playing some kind battleshiptwister game I had to go to the bathroom then walk down to immigration have my passport stamped and then to the gate all took over half an hour by which time we could walk to the plane so no time to rejoin the meeting Instead the engines powered up and we were off to the piano keys but not stopping instead the engines set to maximum as we roared off down the runway and into the air soon lost in clouds I settled back and snoozed though did accept a small bottle of wine and some pistachio ice cream which was all rather pleasant The plane dropped from cruising altitude Essex could be seen through the clouds or parts of it Shoeburyness Southend Westcliff and along the north bank of the Thames getting lower minute by minute One final swoop over the river and touchdown but the fact we were 15 minutes early was tempered by the fact we were put on the most remote pan then had to wait for the steps to be brought then groundcrew to unload the cabin bags too big to be carried in the cabin and finally the bus to take us to the terminal Instead of dropping us near immigration the bus let us off at gate 7 and for me it was a long hobble trying to stay ahead of a larger jet that had followed us down I made it my case was waiting so a dash to the DLR where I had just missed a train to Stratford so have seven minutes When the next train came it was rammed because West Ham were at home and fans were travelling for the clubs old heartland to the new ground in the old Olympic Stadium Each station more drunken singing fans squeezed on until at each of the three Stratford stations half of them got off I walked to the International station and found I had just over 15 minutes before the Dover train arrived so I called Jools arranged for her to be at Priory when I got there at quarter past eight The train was busy but not full I found a place for my case and a seat so I could relax and check on how West Ham were doing on my journey down to the coast We arrived at Dover I had to climb the stairs from platform 2 to the exit Jools was waiting outside she had a bag of KFC freshly collected from the old Market Square so she took us home

        "description": "Cavendish Mews is a smart set of flats in Mayfair where flapper and modern woman the Honourable Lettice Chetwynd has set up home after coming of age and gaining her allowance To supplement her already generous allowance and to break away from dependence upon her family Lettice has established herself as a society interior designer so her flat is decorated with a mixture of elegant antique Georgian pieces and modern Art Deco furnishings using it as a showroom for what she can offer to her well heeled clients This morning Lettice is entertaining a neighbour of sorts of her parents Mr Alisdair Gifford nephew of Sir John NettlefordHughes Old enough to be her father wealthy Sir John is still a bachelor and according to London society gossip intends to remain so so that he might continue to enjoy his dalliances with a string of pretty chorus girls of Lettices age and younger As an eligible man in a time when such men are a rare commodity with a vast family estate in Bedfordshire houses in Mayfair Belgravia and Pimlico and Fontengil Park in Wiltshire quite close to the Glynes estate Lettices mother Lady Sadie invited him as a potential suitor to her 1922 Hunt Ball which she used as a marriage market for Lettice Luckily Selwyn Spencely the handsome eldest son of the Duke of Walmsford rescued Lettice from the horror of having to entertain him and Sir John left the ball early in a disgruntled mood with a much younger partygoer Lettice recently reacquainted herself with Sir John at an amusing Friday to Monday long weekend party held by Sir John and Lady Gladys Caxton at their Scottish country estate Gossington a baronial Art and Crafts castle near the hamlet of Kershopefoot in Cumberland To her surprise Lettice found Sir Johns company rather enjoyable As she was leaving to return to London on the Monday Sir John approached her and asked if she might meet with his nephew Mr Gifford as he wishes to have a room in his Wiltshire house Arkwright Bury redecorated as a surprise for his Australian wife Adelina who collects blue and white porcelain but as of yet has no place to display it at Arkwright Bury With a smile Lettice agreed and thus Mr Gifford now sits opposite her in her Mayfair drawing room She appraises Mr Gifford as he helps himself to a biscuit from the plate on the low coffee table between them He is a slight man probably not more than ten years older than herself with pale patrician skin over a fine bone structure and a mop of auburn hair which is streaked with silvery white hairs possibly prematurely owing to his experiences in the war He is dressed in a very smart morning suit with a silver fob watch chain hanging from his cherry red waistcoat pocket He movements are as delicate as his frame and his sparking blue eyes are further enhanced by the strong prescription of the glasses persistently sliding down his nose Now this is what I wanted to show you Miss Chetwynd Mr Gifford says in well educated and modulated tones from the comfort of one of Lettices round backed Art Deco arm chairs He reaches down with his elongated fingers into the slightly battered and worn brown leather case at his feet which he arrived with but refused to allow Edith Lettices maid to take from him From it he withdraws an old photograph album Covered in vibrant green Morocco leather Lettice notices its bumped corners which have worn down over many years losing their sharp edges and a sun faded spine that tells of sitting for many a year closed on a bookshelf There is no writing on the cover but glancing at the thick creamy card pages contained within the covers she recognises it as a photograph album This is a very precious piece of Arkwright Burys and my own familys history Mr Gifford goes on Im very looking forward to seeing it then Lettice remarks with curiosity as she leans forward in her own armchair I dont know whether my Uncle John told you or not when you were at the Caxtons country house party at Gossington but Arkwright Bury was badly damaged in a fire in 1879 No Lettice admits Your uncle didnt tell me a great deal about Arkwright Bury at all Mr Gifford other than it fell into some disrepair when your elder brother went off to war and that since you and your wife inherited it you have been restoring it Quite right Miss Chetwynd Mr Gifford passes over the album to Lettice who takes it with reverence into her elegant hands However this will give you an idea of what Arkwright Bury used to look like in the 1860s and 70s before the fire Its an album rescued from the conflagration which consists mostly of photographs of the house and its interiors and not family photographs How very unusual Lettice remarks Well my grandfather was very passionate about architecture and photography so I think this may have been a pet project of his And thus perhaps why it was saved Mr Gifford Lettice asks tentatively Perhaps Miss Chetwynd Mr Gifford replies with a gentle shrugging roll of his shoulders Lettice finds an old photograph of an unassuming Regency style country house partially overgrown with creepers set amidst a simple English park style garden on the front page The house has a low pitched roof which is hidden from view by the buildings parapets It has five bays of large sash windows over its two storeys and an Ionic columned portico We think Arkwright Bury may have been designed by Anthony Keck Mr Gifford explains assuming that Lettice will know who the Georgian architect is Although we cannot confirm it Like so many things the precious architectural drawings of Arkwright Bury went up in flames in the 1897 fire I mean his work isnt found in Wiltshire and if it is his then it most probably was built after his retirement and would be the only example in the county I do know it was built in 1796 and Anthony Keck died just a year later And you have brought me this album because Lettice queries as she starts to turn the page Well because this has the only known surviving photograph of the Pagoda Room Mr Gifford answers The Pagoda Room Lettice asks Yes Just flip through the first few pages The gentleman says helpfully as he leans forward over the black japanned coffee table covered with Lettices Art Deco Royal Doulton tea set and tray of biscuits It should be on page six or so Lettice does as he says counting the pages in her mind silently as she turns them Ahh There it is Lettice looks to where he points and there on a thick card page beige and greyish and mottled with age framed by flowers hand painted by one of the more artistic Gifford females of history is an old photograph underneath which is written in a delicate looped hand The Pagoda Room July 1876 Being from 1876 Im sure my grandfather took this photograph Mr Gifford explains It was called the Pagoda Room because as you can see on the walls there is some Georgian wallpaper hand painted and imported from China we assume which features Pagodas on it Of course I wasnt born until after the fire but my father remembers he and his sister my Aunt Eugenia making up stories about Chinese people who lived inside the pagodas I say Lettice laughs How frightfully jolly Lettice looks at the image It depicts the corner of what must have been a larger room with a high dado papered with the Georgian wallpaper Mr Gifford mentioned featuring the stylised pagodas that gave the room its name The corner is filled with Georgian and Regency furniture that is intermixed with pieces from later periods the surfaces of tables and the shadowy interiors of a Georgian corner cabinet are cluttered with a collection of decorative porcelain that owed much to the conscientious consumption of the wealthy in the mid Victorian era Paintings of Gifford ancestors hang on the walls in thick gilt frames whilst a top heavy elaborate floral display of roses and ferns sits atop a heavily carved Victorian pillar Overstuffed yet comfortable looking chairs and sofas fill the space their owners gone but their presence marked by a stack of leatherbound books with decorative covers a sewing basket and embroidery hoop and a silver teapot milk jug and sugar bowl and dainty china teacups on a galleried silver tray My grandmother loved needlework so Im sure thats her embroidery frame and basket in the photograph and my grandfather was an avid reader Indeed Lettice remarks lowering the page and allowing the well loved album to sit comfortably open across her lap as she reaches over to the black japanned side table on which her telephone stands and picks up her teacup And besides for its interesting historical context you have brought me this album why Mr Gifford Well the Arkwright Bury fire tore through that part of the house and destroyed it entirely Miss Chetwynd Mmmm Lettice sips her tea Or at least I thought it had until recently Mr Gifford continues Go on Mr Gifford Well as my uncle explained to you Adelinde and I have almost completed a full restoration of Arkwright Bury and we only have a small amount left to do This includes my brother Cuthberts study He died before the end of the war didnt he Mr Gifford Lettice asks gently He did Miss Chetwynd He was honourably discharged after the Battle of Ypres but he came back a very changed man You never went to France yourself did you Mr Gifford No Mr Gifford admits a little guiltily But please dont hold that against me Miss Chetwynd I wasnt accepted because of my appalling eyesight He pushes his pair of thick lensed glasses up the bridge of his aquiline nose with awkward embarrassment I did however work under Mr Churchill in the Admiralty I wont hold your not going to battle in Flanders Fields against you Mr Gifford Lettice assures him with a comforting smile Thank you he sighs Thats a relief Anyway the war has been over for more than five years now Not for some people it hasnt Mr Gifford says sadly And just because Im not maimed physically like those poor returned soldiers you see selling matches at the top of Tottenham Court Road or in Piccadilly Circus there is a certain amount of stigma against me people thinking I didnt do my bit during the war Well I wont jump to any incorrect conclusions about what you did or didnt do during the war My eldest brother returned from the conflict with all his limbs intact both his eyes and most importantly his mind unaltered thank god so Im hardly in a position to judge you for a lack of injuries Well many others feel differently especially those young embittered war widows or fiances of which there are so many about You were not affianced to a young officer or captain yourself Miss Chetwynd Thankfully no Mr Gifford Poor Cuthbert came back with all his limbs and his sight but his mind was disturbed from what he witnessed over in France and he killed himself shot himself in the temple with his gun before Armistice Day Mr Gifford says dryly Yes I had heard the rumour Lettice murmurs quietly in admission And thats why his study is one of the last places Adelina and I have to deal with Too many painful memories Mr Gifford Yes he admits But also too much mess quite frankly As I said Cuthbert came back from the Western Front with his mind addled and his study reflects that with piles of papers and books in all kinds of disorder the meaning of which known only to him so its just been too hard to deal with In fact Adelina and I closed the door on it and more often than not have been using it as a storage room whilst weve been restoring other parts of Arkwright Bury shoving furniture and boxes of things between Cuthberts belongings Recently Adelina has been using it to store her boxes of blue and white porcelain that we brought over from Briar Priory plus a few newly acquired pieces He sighs Its actually only been recently that I have had the stomach to start sorting out Cuthberts things Adelina wants to turn the study into a display room for her collection since we cant seem to find anywhere else suitable in Arkwright Bury to display it which seems odd He laughs When you think that Briar Priory was so much smaller than Arkwright Bury is And thats why youve come to see me Lettice asks trying to get Mr Gifford to explain himself and share his intentions Yes Mr Gifford agrees If youre willing to take it on Id love for you to redecorate Cuthberts study as a surprise for Adelina It would make it a happy space to be in rather than a sad and neglected one Although that still doesnt explain the necessity for this Lettice half raises the green Morocco leather photo album in her lap with her spare left hand Well I wanted you to look at the photo of the Pagoda Room because I thought it had been completely destroyed by the fire until I started going through Cuthberts study Before it was Cuthberts study it was my fathers study and my grandfathers before him So much Gifford history was lost with the fire that my grandparents didnt have the heart to try and replicate what they had and the study was created from part of the shell of the Pagoda Room How do you know this Mr Gifford Well do you see that corner cabinet Mr Gifford points to a glass door decorated with delicate fretwork half hidden in the shadows behind the elaborate floral arrangement on the pedestal When Lettice affirms with a nod he continues Well I didnt recognise it at first but this is what my brother father and grandfather all used as a corner bookcase It was only when I was doing an inventory of Cuthberts books in it that I suddenly looked at the door and I recognised it as being the same one from the photograph of the Pagoda Room So I took out my penknife He withdraws a small blade with an ebony handle from his pocket So useful I never go anywhere without it being in my pocket and I took to the red wallpaper just next to the cabinet I cut away a little and what do you think I found beneath it Miss Chetwynd The Chinese pagoda paper I presume Mr Gifford Lettice laughs Just so Miss Chetwynd Mr Gifford exclaims bouncing on his seat excitedly Its badly degraded of course but I thought it would make a splendid backdrop to Adelinas blue and white porcelain collection Aah then Im very sorry Mr Gifford Lettice begins to apologise But you have wasted your journey up to London from Wiltshire Im a redecorator and designer not a restorer Oh I know that Miss Chetwynd Mr Gifford replies However I also know from what I read in Mr Tippings article in Country Life that you are a fine artist You painted a demilune table for Mr and Mrs Channon did you not I did Mr Gifford But what of it I had rather thought you might paint the design of the pagoda wallpaper from this photograph for me A demilune table is entirely different to a mural Mr Gifford Lettice exclaims in horror Im hardly a muralist Oh Im sorry Miss Chetwynd if I in any way implied that I wanted you to paint a mural Mr Gifford defends raising his hands in concern No I thought that because you have connections with wallpaper manufacturers who produce papers based on individual designs submitted I was rather hoping you would design a panel of the pagoda wallpaper which could then be reproduced as wallpaper to hang Lettice ruminates on Mr Giffords idea for a moment Well she says cautiously I suppose I could speak to Jeffrey and Company They do produce bespoke wall hangings Mind you to be frank it isnt at all inexpensive Mr Gifford Oh I dont mind Miss Chetwynd The Pagoda Room may have been large once but I can assure you that Cuthberts study isnt a terribly large space I certainly dont mind paying the cost to have it papered Well I know its precious to you but may I have this photograph then Mr Gifford Of course you may Miss Chetwynd Just slip it out of the album As Lettice carefully extracts the old black and white photograph from the album she says I can see if I can recreate a design as close to the original as I can make out from this photograph I take it you can tell me what the colours of it are from the little bit of paper you exposed I have it here Miss Chetwynd Mr Gifford replies with a sigh delving into his satchel once more and withdrawing a crumbling piece of paper that shows a small piece of the pagoda door and some roof tiles in French blue and sage green on an ecru background that must once have been white which he carefully hands over to Lettice with trembling fingers Yes well Using this I could come up with a panel that once it meets your approval I can then take to Jeffrey and Company and see if they are willing to reproduce it and at what price Capital Miss Chetwynd Capital Mr Gifford enthuses excitedly Id have to see the room as well Mr Gifford Lettice says To establish the amount of wall space we are discussing to have papered Are you by chance coming down to Wiltshire to visit your family soon Miss Chetwynd asks Mr Gifford with a toothy smile As a matter of fact I am Mr Gifford Then perhaps I could extend an invitation to you to take tea with my wife and I at Arkwright Bury whilst you are in residence at Glynes That sounds splendid Mr Gifford Of course you cannot let on to Adelina about this Miss Chetwynd This would be strictly between us I want this redecoration to be a surprise for her You are being presumptuous Mr Gifford I havent said that I will take you on as my client yet Lettice cautions with a wagging finger There are many dependencies and counterdependencies yet to consider But I will consider your request after I have seen the room for myself Oh thank you Miss Chetwynd Mr Gifford replies clapping his hands in delight I said consider Mr Gifford Lettice says again attempting to temper Mr Giffords enthusiasm Well thinking of consideration Miss Chetwynd I do have one final titbit that might just make you consider my request a little more favourably He pauses for affect And what might that be Mr Gifford Lettice asks with intrigue Well Mr Henry Tipping is my godfather Mr Gifford says with a smile that makes him look like the cat who just ate the cream And when I mentioned your name to him as a potential candidate for redecorating Cuthberts study he said to me that he would happily consider writing an article on your redecoration of the room for Country Life if you agreed Well Lettice replies her expertly shaped eyebrows arching over her glittering blue eyes That is an interesting incentive Mr Gifford I thought that might pique your interest Miss Chetwynd Mr Gifford replies with a satisfied sigh as he settles back in his armchair again Anthony Keck 1726 1797 was an Eighteenth Century English architect with an extensive practice in Gloucestershire Worcestershire Herefordshire and South Wales He designed at least fifty country houses in the SouthWest of England and South Wales The Battle of Ypres was a series of engagements during the First World War near the Belgian city of Ypres between the German and the Allied armies Belgian French British Expeditionary Force and Canadian Expeditionary Force During the five engagements casualties may have surpassed one million Sir Winston Churchill 30th if November 1874 24th of January 1965 was a British statesman soldier and writer who twice served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 during the Second World War and again from 1951 to 1955 Apart from two years between 1922 and 1924 he was a Member of Parliament from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five constituencies Ideologically an adherent to economic liberalism and imperialism he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party which he led from 1940 to 1955 He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924 In October 1911 Prime Minister Asquith appointed Churchill First Lord of the Admiralty and he took up official residence at Admiralty House He created a naval war staff and over the next two and a half years focused on naval preparation visiting naval stations and dockyards seeking to improve morale and scrutinising German naval developments As First Lord Churchill was tasked with overseeing Britains naval effort when the First World War began in August 1914 In the same month the navy transported 120000 British troops to France and began a blockade of Germanys North Sea ports Churchill sent submarines to the Baltic Sea to assist the Russian Navy and he sent the Marine Brigade to Ostend forcing a reallocation of German troops In September Churchill assumed full responsibility for Britains aerial defence In May Asquith agreed under parliamentary pressure to form an allparty coalition government but the Conservatives condition of entry was that Churchill must be removed from the Admiralty Churchill pleaded his case with both Asquith and Conservative leader Bonar Law but had to accept demotion and became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster The term Flanders Fields used after the war to refer to the parts of France where the bloodiest battles of the Great War raged comes from quotIn Flanders Fieldsquot is a war poem in the form of a rondeau written during the First World War by Canadian physician LieutenantColonel John McCrae written in 1915 Armistice Day or

gardens garden designer in his own right and Architectural Editor of the British periodical Country Life for seventeen years between 1907 and 1910 and 1916 and 1933 After his appointment to that position in 1907 he became recognised as one of the leading authorities on the history architecture furnishings and gardens of country houses in Britain In 1927 he became a member of the first committee of the Gardens of England and Wales Scheme later known as the National Gardens Scheme Country Life is a British weekly perfectbound glossy magazine that is a quintessential English magazine founded in 1897 providing readers with a weekly dose of architecture gardens and interiors It was based in London at 110 Southwark Street until March 2016 when it became based in Farnborough Hampshire The frontispiece of each issue usually features a portrait photograph of a young woman of society or on occasion a man of society A demilune is a halfmoon shaped table that was created and very popular in the Eighteenth Century With no hard edges or corners and a shallow profile this type of accent table works well in so many tight spaces Georgian rooms were often quite small so they were a useful surface to have in bedrooms hallways and entryways Jeffrey and Company was an English producer of fine wallpapers that operated between 1836 and the mid 1930s Based at 64 Essex Road in London the firm worked with a variety of designers who were active in the aesthetic and arts and crafts movements such as EW Godwin William Morris and Walter Crane Jeffrey and Companys success is often credited to Metford Warner who became the companys chief proprietor in 1871 Under his direction the firm became one of the most lucrative and influential wallpaper manufacturers in Europe The company clarified that wallpaper should not be reserved for use solely in mansions but should be available for rooms in the homes of the emerging uppermiddle class This may look like an old photograph taken in the Victorian era and inserted into a photograph album affixed with corners but it is in fact a photograph made up completely of pieces from my 112 miniatures collection including pieces from my teenage years which has then been post produced as an old black and white photograph Fun things to look for in this tableau include The embroidery frame which features a partially completed embroidery complete with a 112 miniature needle inserted into it was made by Falcon Miniatures who are known for their detail in relation to their miniature pieces I acquired it from Doreen Jeffreys Small Wonders Miniatures in the United Kingdom The sewing basket sitting next to it on the overstuffed sofa is a 112 artisan miniature which I have had since I was a teenager I acquired it from a high street dolls house and miniatures supplier and it is amongst my very first artisan pieces I purchased The silver tea set on the pedestal table consisting of milk jug sugar bowl and teapot come from Warwick Miniatures in Ireland who are well known for the quality and detail applied to their pieces The silver tray upon which they stand also comes from Warwick Miniatures The two dainty floral teacups with gilt edging are part of a larger tea set that I acquired from Beautifully Handmade Miniatures in Kettering The books on the table by the slipper chair and on the sofa in the forefront of the picture are 112 size miniatures made by the British miniature artisan Ken Blythe Most of the books I own that he has made may be opened to reveal authentic printed interiors In some cases you can even read the words depending upon the size of the print I have quite a large representation of Ken Blythes work in my collection but so little of his real artistry is seen because the books that he specialised in making are usually closed sitting on shelves or closed on desks and table surfaces These books are amongst the rarer exceptions that have been designed not to be opened Nevertheless the covers are copies of real Victorian bindings What might amaze you even more is that all Ken Blythes books and magazines are authentically replicated 112 scale miniatures of real volumes To create something so authentic to the original in such detail and so clearly really does make this a miniature artisan piece Ken Blythes work is highly sought after by miniaturists around the world today and command high prices at auction for such tiny pieces particularly now that he is no longer alive I was fortunate enough to acquire pieces from Ken Blythe prior to his death about four years ago as well as through his estate via his daughter and soninlaw His legacy will live on with me and in my photography which I hope will please his daughter The overstuffed white settee and matching slipper chair the two pedestal tables the demilune table upon which the three vases sit the three vases themselves the corner cabinet and the china inside it the hand embroidered footstool in front of the slipper chair the two pillows on the sofa in the foreground the paintings on the walls the extravagant floral arrangement and the two matching ornamental Victorian pillars I acquired from Kathleen Knights Dolls House Shop in the United Kingdom The hand painted oriental ginger jar on the pedestal in the background next to the corner cabinet I acquired from Melody Janes Doll House Suppliers in the United Kingdom The floral sofa in the foreground I obtained from Crooked Mile Cottage Miniatures in the United States The oriental rug is a copy of a popular 1920s style Chinese silk rug and has been machine woven The wallpaper is an Eighteenth Century chinoiserie design of pagodas and would have been hand painted in its original form",

that are low in carbohydrates and high in fats such as mediumchain triglycerides MCTs derived from sources like coconut oil These gummies are often formulated to provide a convenient and tasty way to increase your fat intake while minimizing carbohydrate consumption which is a key aspect of the keto diet While specific ingredients can vary between products Essential Keto Gummies Australia commonly contain components like MCT oil exogenous ketones vitamins and natural flavors These gummies are intended to help individuals maintain ketosis a metabolic state where the body primarily burns fats for energy instead of carbohydrates Its essential to note that while these gummies can be a convenient addition to a keto diet they should not replace a wellbalanced diet or serve as the sole source of nutrients As with any dietary supplement its advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating Essential Keto Gummies or any similar product into your routine especially if you have any underlying health conditions or concerns CHECK AVAILABLE DISCOUNT PRICE BY TAPING HERE OFFICIAL WEBSITE Scientific Evidences Backing Essential Keto Gummies MCT Oil Mediumchain triglycerides MCTs are fats that are more easily absorbed and metabolized by the body compared to longchain triglycerides LCTs which are found in many other dietary fats Some studies suggest that MCT oil can increase ketone production and may aid in weight management and improving cognitive function However more research is needed to fully understand its effects Exogenous Ketones These are ketone bodies that are consumed externally typically in the form of supplements Exogenous ketones can elevate blood ketone levels which may help induce ketosis and provide a source of energy especially during the initial stages of transitioning to a ketogenic diet Some studies suggest that exogenous ketones may improve athletic performance and cognitive function but more research is needed to confirm these effects Vitamins and Minerals Many Keto Gummies Australia contain vitamins and minerals to support overall health and wellbeing These may include electrolytes like magnesium potassium and sodium which are important for maintaining hydration and electrolyte balance especially during the initial stages of the keto diet when electrolyte imbalances are common While individual ingredients in keto gummies may have scientific evidence supporting their potential benefits its important to note that the specific formulation and combination of ingredients in a particular product can vary Therefore its essential to evaluate the scientific evidence for each ingredient individually and consider the overall quality and safety of the product as a whole If youre interested in the scientific evidence

a convenient source of energy for those following a ketogenic diet Vitamins and Minerals Many keto gummies also contain vitamins and minerals to support overall health and wellbeing These may include electrolytes such as magnesium potassium and sodium which are important for maintaining hydration and electrolyte balance Natural Flavors and Sweeteners To enhance taste keto gummies may contain natural flavors and sweeteners like stevia or erythritol which provide sweetness without significantly impacting blood sugar levels Other Ingredients Depending on the specific formulation keto gummies

An onion Allium cepa L from Latin cepa meaning quotonionquot also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which may irritate the eyes Taxonomy and etymology Roots leaves and developing bulb The onion plant Allium cepa also known as the bulb onion or common onion 910 is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium It was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum A number of synonyms have appeared in its taxonomic history Allium cepa var aggregatum G Don Allium cepa var bulbiferum Regel Allium cepa var cepa Linnaeus Allium cepa var multiplicans LH Bailey Allium cepa var proliferum Moench Regel Allium cepa var solaninum Alef Allium cepa var viviparum Metz Mansf A cepa is known exclusively from cultivation but related wild species occur in Central Asia and Iran The most closely related species include A vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A asarense from Iran The vast majority of cultivars of A cepa belong to the common onion group A cepa var cepa and are usually referred to simply as onions The Aggregatum Group of cultivars A cepa var aggregatum includes both shallots and potato onions 2021 The genus Allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion A fistulosum Egyptian onion A proliferum and Canada onion A canadense 910 Cepa is commonly accepted as Latin for quotonionquot and has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from

umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",

plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The

been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Sauting onions Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow

are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The

An onion Allium cepa L from Latin cepa meaning quotonionquot also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011 21 Its close relatives include garlic scallion leek and chive Quick Facts Scientific classification Binomial name This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum the tree onion Allium proliferum and the Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which may irritate the eyes Taxonomy and etymology Roots leaves and developing bulb The onion plant Allium cepa also known as the bulb onion or common onion 910 is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium It was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum A number of synonyms have

Moench Regel Allium cepa var solaninum Alef Allium cepa var viviparum Metz Mansf A cepa is known exclusively from cultivation but related wild species occur in Central Asia and Iran The most closely related species include A vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A asarense from Iran The vast majority of cultivars of A cepa belong to the common onion group A cepa var cepa and are usually referred to simply as onions The Aggregatum Group of cultivars A cepa var aggregatum includes both shallots and potato onions 2021 The genus Allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as

has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The

Canada onion Allium canadense The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species but A cepa is exclusively known from cultivation Its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season The onion plant has a fan of hollow bluishgreen leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain daylength is reached The bulbs are composed of shortened compressed underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale leaves that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem In the autumn or in spring in the case of overwintering onions the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi which can cause rotting Some varieties of A cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs Onions are cultivated and used around the world As a food item they are usually served rawcitation needed as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which may irritate the eyes Taxonomy and etymology Roots leaves and developing bulb The onion plant Allium cepa also known as the bulb onion or common onion 910 is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium It was first officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum A number of synonyms have appeared in its taxonomic history Allium cepa var aggregatum G Don Allium cepa var bulbiferum Regel Allium cepa var cepa Linnaeus Allium cepa var multiplicans LH Bailey Allium cepa var proliferum Moench Regel Allium cepa var solaninum Alef Allium cepa var viviparum Metz Mansf A cepa is known exclusively from cultivation but related wild species occur in Central Asia and Iran The most closely related species include A vavilovii from Turkmenistan and A asarense from Iran The vast majority of cultivars of A cepa belong to the common onion group A cepa var cepa and are usually referred to simply as onions The Aggregatum Group of cultivars A cepa var aggregatum includes both shallots and potato onions 2021 The genus Allium also contains a number of other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the Japanese bunching onion A fistulosum Egyptian onion A proliferum and Canada onion A canadense 910 Cepa is commonly accepted as Latin for quotonionquot and has an affinity with Ancient Greek kpia and Albanian qep and is ancestral to Aromanian tseap Catalan ceba Occitan ceba Portuguese cebola Spanish cebolla Italian cipolla and Romanian ceap The English word quotchivequot is also derived from the Old French cive which derived from cepa Description The onion has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7000 years It is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm 6 to 18 in The leaves are yellowish to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened fanshaped swathe They are fleshy hollow and cylindrical with one flattened side They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up beyond which they taper to blunt tips The base of each leaf is a flattened usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb From the underside of the plate a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil As the onion matures food reserves accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells Inflorescence with flower buds In the autumn the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle so the crop is normally harvested If left in the soil over winter the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring New leaves appear and a long stout hollow stem expands topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes The seeds are glossy black and triangular in crosssection The average pH of an onion is around 55 Indian onions History Medieval woodcut print depicting an onion from the Latin encyclopedia Hortus Sanitatis 1547 The history of ancestral onion species is not well documented Ancient records of onion use spans western and eastern Asia so the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain Yet domestication likely took place in West or Central Asia 2021 Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran western Pakistan and Central Asia 1 Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC not only for their flavour but also for the bulbs durability in storage and transportfailed verification Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life Onions were used in Egyptian burials as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii He documented Roman beliefs about the onions ability to improve ocular ailments aid in sleep and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites lumbago and even dysentery Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Plinys detailed narratives According to texts collected in the fifthsixth century AD under the authorial aegis of quotApiciusquot said to have been a gourmet onions were used in many Roman recipes In the Age of Discovery onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers who found close relatives of the plant such as Allium tricoccum readily available and widely used in Native American gastronomy According to diaries kept by certain first English colonists the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrims Uses Onion types and products Common onions are normally available in three colour varieties Yellow or brown onions are sweet with many cultivars bred specifically to accentuate this sweetness such as Vidalia Walla Walla Cvennes and Bermuda Yellow onions turn a rich dark brown when caramelised and are used to add a sweet flavour to various dishes such as French onion soup Red or purple onions known for their sharp pungent flavour are commonly cooked in many cuisines They are also used raw and in grilling White onions are mild in flavour they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sauted Jar of pickled onions While the large mature onion bulb is most often eaten onions can be eaten at immature stages Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions When an onion is harvested after bulbing has begun but the onion is not yet mature the plants are sometimes referred to as quotsummerquot onions Additionally onions may be bred and grown to mature at smaller sizes Depending on the mature size and the purpose for which the onion is used these may be referred to as pearl boiler or pickler onions but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a longlasting relish Onions are available in fresh frozen canned caramelised pickled and chopped forms The dehydrated product is available as kibbled sliced ring minced chopped granulated and powder forms Onion powder is a seasoning widely used when the fresh ingredient is not available It is made from finely ground dehydrated onions mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions and has a strong odour Being dehydrated it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties yellow red and white Culinary See also List of onion dishes Onions are commonly chopped and used as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes and may also be used as a main ingredient in their own right for example in French onion soup creamed onions and onion chutney They are versatile and can be baked boiled braised grilled fried roasted sauted or eaten raw in salads Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked facilitating stuffing them as in Turkish sogandolma Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack around the world and as a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth They are part of a traditional British pubs ploughmans lunch usually served with crusty bread English cheese and ale Similar to garlic onions can show an additional colour pinkred after cutting an effect caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds Oils Onion oil is authorised for use in the European Union for use as a pesticide against carrot fly in umbelliferous crops carrots parsnips parsley celery celeriac Onions also contain one of the natural oils sometimes used in hair oil Education Onion epidermis cells are well known to be visible in true color with only minimal magnification such as this red onion skin Onions have particularly large cells that are readily observed under low magnification Forming a single layer of cells the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational experimental and breeding purposes Onions are therefore commonly used in science education to teach the use of a microscope for observing cell structure Dye Onion skins can be boiled to make an orangebrown dye Composition Nutrients Quick Facts Nutritional value per 100 g 35 oz Energy Most onion cultivars are about 89 water 9 carbohydrates including 4 sugar and 2 dietary fibre 1 protein and negligible fat table Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients and have an energy value of 166 kJ 40 kilocalories in a 100 g 35 oz amount Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant caloric content Phytochemicals Considerable differences exist between onion varieties in phytochemical content particularly for polyphenols with shallots having the highest level six times the amount found in Vidalia onions Yellow onions have the highest total flavonoid content an amount 11 times higher than in white onions Red onions have considerable content of anthocyanin pigments with at least 25 different compounds identified representing 10 of total flavonoid content Onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans Allergic reactions Some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions Symptoms can include contact dermatitis intense itching rhinoconjunctivitis blurred vision bronchial asthma sweating and anaphylaxis Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking Eye irritation Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the lacrimal glands in the eyes to become irritated releasing tears Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby and often uncontrollable tears This is caused by the release of a volatile liquid synpropanethialSoxide and its aerosol which stimulates nerves in the eye This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids A specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme the lacrimatory factor synthase LFS producing the synpropanethialSoxide This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes where it activates sensory neurons Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among Allium species In 2008 the New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research created quotno tearsquot onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavour of onions with lower LFS content Since the process impedes sulfur ingestion by the plant some find LFS onions inferior in flavour A method for efficiently differentiating LFS and LFS onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry with potential application in highvolume production gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions In early 2018 Bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available LFSsilenced onions under the name quotSunionsquot They were the product of 30 years of crossbreeding genetic modification was not employed Guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor Synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders Onion bulbs used for planting and seeds Toxicity to animals Onions are toxic to dogs cats guinea pigs and many other animals Cultivation Largescale onion cultivation Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are welldrained Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting Bulbing onions are daylength sensitive their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity Most traditional European onions are referred to as quotlongdayquot onions producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs Southern European and North African varieties are often known as quotintermediatedayquot types requiring only 1213 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation quotShortdayquot onions which have been developed in more recent times are planted in mildwinter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring and require only 1112 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation Onions are a coolweather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9 Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to quotboltquot meaning that a flower stem begins to grow 1905 cartoon about high market prices for onions Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown bulbs called quotsetsquot or starter bulbs Because onion seeds are shortlived fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow rows or quotdrillsquot with each drill 12quot to 18quot apart In suitable climates certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small followed by drying and storage These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds especially when the plants are young The plants are shallowrooted and do not need much water when established Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh but if they will be stored they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally In dry weather they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying then placed in nets roped into strings or laid in layers in shallow boxes They are stored effectively in a wellventilated cool place Pests and diseases Larvae of the onion fly Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly stem and bulb eelworm white rot and neck rot Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut downy mildew and white tip disease The bulbs may be affected by splitting white rot and neck rot Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasantsmelling slime Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb The onion fly Delia antiqua lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion shallot leek and garlic plants The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow The bulbs are disfigured and rot especially in wet weather Control measures may include crop rotation the use of seed dressings early sowing or planting and the removal of infested plants The onion eelworm Ditylenchus dipsaci a tiny parasitic soilliving nematode causes swollen distorted foliage Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots parsnips and beans which are also susceptible to the eelworm White rot of onions leeks and garlic is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum As the roots rot the foliage turns yellow and wilts The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia which later produces small globular black structures called sclerotia These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop No cure for this fungal disease exists so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage It is caused by Botrytis allii which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb causing a grey mould to develop The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread down the affected scales Large quantities of spores are produced and crustlike sclerotia may also develop In time a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry mummified structure This disease may be present throughout the growing period but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting careful drying and curing of the mature onions and correct storage in a cool dry place with plenty of circulating air More information Production of onions and shallots green in 2021 Country Production Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience England using a manuallyoperated sorter In 2021 world production of onions and shallots as green produce was 46 million tonnes led by China with 19 of the world total with Mali Japan and South Korea as secondary producers Storage In the home Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature optimally in a single layer in large mesh bags in a dry cool dark wellventilated location In this environment cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears Also they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions This makes them sweeter and milder tasting but reduces their shelf life Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated they have a shelf life of around 1 month Irrespective of type any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped stored away from other produce and used within two to three days Varieties Common onion group var cepa Most of the diversity within A cepa occurs within this group the most economically important Allium crop Plants within this group form large single bulbs and are grown from seed or seedgrown sets The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs salad onions and pickling onions belong to this group 2021 The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod length of day that triggers bulbing storage life flavour and skin colour Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions such as the Vidalia from Georgia US or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich",
